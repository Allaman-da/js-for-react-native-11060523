# Array Manipulation

This project comprises three tasks that are implemented in separate JavaScript files.

## Task 1: processArray

The `arrayManipulation.js` file includes a function called `processArray`. It accepts an array of numbers as input and generates a new array. In the resulting array, each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2: formatArrayStrings

Inside the `arrayManipulation.js` file, there exists a function named `formatArrayStrings`. This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers that have been processed by the `processArray` function. The function alters each string based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the string is capitalized; otherwise, it is converted to lowercase.

## Task 3: createUserProfiles

The `userInfo.js` file contains a function called `createUserProfiles`. It accepts two arrays as parameters: an array of names and an array of modified names obtained from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, with each object including the original name, modified name, and an ID that starts from 1 and increments automatically.

Feel free to customize and expand upon these functions according to your specific needs.
